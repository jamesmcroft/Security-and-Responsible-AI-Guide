# Chapter 2: Designing Secure, Responsible AI Solutions

Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the way that customers interact with services provided by ISVs and Digital Natives. But, as with any technology, it comes with significant risks and challenges.

For organizations building solutions with AI capabilities, you have the responsibility to ensure that your implementations are secure, ethical, and trustworthy. This chapter provides guidance on how to design secure, responsible AI solutions on Azure.

## Assessing the responsible AI impact of your solutions

The first step in designing a responsible AI solution is to explore the potential impact of your solution on your customers. This will help you to identify the risks and challenges that you need to address early in the design process.

Microsoft's [Responsible AI Impact Assessment Guide](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-RAI-Impact-Assessment-Guide.pdf), and corresponding [Impact Assessment Template](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-RAI-Impact-Assessment-Template.pdf) provide a framework for you to assess the potential impact that your AI use case may have, aligned to Microsoft's [Principles for Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai) as discussed in the previous chapter. It is a tool to:

- **Explore** the potential impact of your system on people and society, giving you the opportunity to consider both benefits and harms for different individuals and groups.
- **Identify** the relevant goals and requirements for your solution from Microsoft's Principles for Responsible AI including fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.
- **Document** your AI use case responsibility profile, data requirements, potential limitations and failures, and potential misuse scenarios.
- **Communicate** across your organization and stakeholders on the impact, challenges, and mitigation for your use case to ensure that you are building a responsible AI solution.

The Responsible AI Impact Assessment should be completed collaboratively by your team members with varying perspectives and expertise. As your system and use cases evolve, you should revisit the assessment to ensure that you are still committed to building a responsible AI solution. Adopting this process will help to make well informed decisions and guide responsible AI practices throughout the development lifecycle of your solution.
